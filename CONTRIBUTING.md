## What kinds of contributions are expected

Improving the list by adding/removing, reorganizing/reordering, labeling/reviewing open resources are all examples of helpful contributions. When in doubt you can always [open a ticket](https://github.com/PandaWhoCodes/awesome-go-in-education/issues/new) or comment existing ones.

## Ground Rules
* Content and code should use a free license.
* Proposed resources should be usable (mainly) by teachers for students (secondary, vocational education and training -VET- and post-secondary levels) as well as self-learners.
